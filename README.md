## Running Locally

Pace Playground is a React application. It was created using [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) with the TypeScript template:
```
yarn create react-app ch-bootstrap --template typescript
```
So you can run locally with: `yarn start`

The other standard scripts exist also: `yarn test`, `yard build`, etc.
